          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Docker is an open-source platform for automating the deployment,
            scaling, and management of applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent years, Docker has gained popularity in the development
            community for its ability to simplify local development
            environments.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
          <p>
            Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to
            package an application and its dependencies into a single unit,
            called a container.
          </p>
          <p>
            Containers are isolated from the host system and can run on any
            environment that has Docker installed, making it easier to move
            applications between different systems.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <section>
            <h2>Benefits of using Docker for Local Development</h2>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Consistent Development Environments</h2>
            <p>
              Docker allows developers to create a consistent and predictable
              environment for their applications, eliminating the "it works on
              my machine" problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              This consistency makes it easier to collaborate with other
              developers and reduces the time spent resolving
              environment-related issues.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Easy Configuration and Deployment</h2>
            <p>
              Docker provides an easy way to configure and deploy applications,
              making it easier to manage dependencies and configurations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dockerfiles allow developers to automate the process of building
              images, which can be used to deploy the same environment on
              multiple systems.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Improved Resource Management</h2>
            <p>
              Docker containers are isolated from the host system, which means
              that applications running inside containers can't interfere with
              each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              This makes it easier to manage system resources, reducing the risk
              of performance issues and improving stability.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Reduced Overhead</h2>
            <p>
              Docker containers are lightweight and don't require a full virtual
              machine, making it faster and more efficient than traditional
              virtualization methods.
            </p>

            <h2>Kubernetes</h2>
            <p>
              Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the
              deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
              It works well with Docker and can be used to manage large-scale
              deployments across multiple systems.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Serverless Computing</h2>
            <p>
              Serverless computing is a cloud-based model in which the cloud
              provider manages the infrastructure, allowing developers to focus
              on writing code. Serverless computing can be used to build and
              deploy applications quickly and cost-effectively.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Infrastructure as Code (IAC)</h2>
            <p>
              Infrastructure as code (IAC) is a method of managing
              infrastructure through code, rather than manual configuration.
              This can be done using tools such as <strong>Terraform</strong>,
              which allows teams to automate the deployment and management of
              their infrastructure.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</h2>
            <p>
              CI/CD is a software development practice in which code changes are
              automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. This
              allows teams to deliver new features and bug fixes faster and with
              greater confidence.
            </p>

            <h2>Microservices Architecture</h2>
            <p>
              Microservices architecture is a method of building applications as
              a collection of small, independent services, rather than a single,
              monolithic application. This can be used to improve scalability,
              maintainability, and resilience.

            <h2>Best practices teams use with Docker</h2>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Use Official Images</h2>
            <p>
              The best way to get started with Docker is to use official images
              from Docker Hub. These images are maintained by the PHP community
              and are guaranteed to work with your application.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Keep Containers Small</h2>
            <p>
              It's a good practice to keep your containers as small as possible.
              This makes it easier to manage your containers, reduces the risk
              of security vulnerabilities, and makes it easier to share your
              images with others.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Use Environment Variables for Configuration</h2>
            <p>
              Avoid hardcoding configuration values in your Dockerfiles.
              Instead, use environment variables to store configuration values,
              which makes it easier to manage different environments.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Keep Your Dockerfiles Complexity Low</h2>
            <p>
              Dockerfiles are the blueprint for your containers, and it's
              important to keep them as simple as possible. Avoid using complex
              shell scripts, and instead focus on using Docker's built-in
              commands to create a clean and easy-to-follow image.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Use Docker Compose for Multi-Container Applications</h2>
            <p>
              If your application requires multiple containers to run, use
              Docker Compose to manage the containers. Docker Compose makes it
              easy to define and manage multi-container applications, reducing
              the risk of configuration issues.
            </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Docker is a powerful tool for local development, offering a range of
            benefits including consistent development environments, easy
            configuration and deployment, improved resource management, and
            reduced overhead.
          </p>
          <p>
            With its growing popularity, Docker is rapidly becoming an essential
            tool for developers looking to streamline their workflow and improve
            the quality of their code.
